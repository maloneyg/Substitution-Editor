{"name":"Substitution-editor","tagline":"A Java program for creating and editing rhombic substitution tilings","body":"![A substitution tiling with sevenfold rotation symmetry](https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/gregory.maloney/files/2015/10/substitution-editor-sample.png)\r\n\r\nSubstitution Editor is a Java program that allows the user to create rhombic substitutions tilings.  It is based on [this paper in Discrete Mathematics & Theoretical Computer Science](http://www.dmtcs.org/dmtcs-ojs/index.php/dmtcs/article/view/2702).  \r\n\r\nThe tiles are rhombs with angles that are integer multiples of 180/N degrees, where N is an odd number (the selectable values of which are 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13).  There are (N - 1)/2 such rhombs, and it is possible to arrange N copies of the one with angles (2,N-2,2,N-2) to form an N-pointed star.  For some inflation factors, it is possible to find substitutions in which these N-pointed stars actually appear.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
